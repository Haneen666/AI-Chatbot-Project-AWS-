# 📊 Machine Learning Models Project

An **individual project** where I independently designed, implemented, and evaluated multiple **Machine Learning models** to solve classification and prediction problems using real-world datasets.

🚀 Built end-to-end — from data preprocessing to model deployment.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the complete Machine Learning workflow:

- Data collection and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Performance evaluation
- Making predictions on new data

The goal was to apply ML techniques to real-world problems and compare different algorithms to find the best-performing solution.

## 🏗️ My Responsibilities
This was a **fully individual project**, and I independently:

- Collected and prepared datasets
- Engineered and selected features
- Trained multiple ML models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Tuned hyperparameters
- Evaluated performance using accuracy & confusion matrix
- Visualized results with charts and graphs
- Documented the entire workflow
